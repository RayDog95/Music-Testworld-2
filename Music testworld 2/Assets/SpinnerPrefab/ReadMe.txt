This spinner requires Udon Sharp(by Merlin) https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp

It is a remake of the prefab spin the bottle by fionna, but for udon. Thank you fionna for the original!

Place in the world and it should work, you can replace the 3dArrowBlue with any mesh you like without breaking anything as long as you remove the collider, if any collider is on the object you are adding.

Any questions or issues message me on discord at FireTik#1246
